# 🎯 Playwright Automation Learning

This repository contains exercises and projects to learn **Playwright automation** through hands-on examples and practical tasks.

## 📘 Overview

The repository covers the following Playwright topics:

- **Mini-Bank Project**: Building and automating a simple banking application  
- **Navigation & Assertions**: Controlling page navigation and verifying content with assertions  
- **Forms Automation**: Filling, submitting, and validating forms  
- **Waits & Timeouts**: Handling dynamic content and managing waits effectively  
- **Screenshots & Videos**: Capturing page states and recording test runs  
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Structuring tests for scalability and maintainability  

## 🏦 Mini-Bank Project

Automate basic banking operations such as:  

- Logging in and out  
- Creating and managing accounts  
- Performing transactions  
- Verifying account balances  

## 🌐 Navigation & Assertions

Learn to:  

- Navigate between pages using Playwright APIs  
- Use assertions to verify element visibility, content, and states  
- Validate correct navigation and page behavior  

## 📝 Forms Automation

Practice automating forms by:  

- Filling input fields and text areas  
- Selecting dropdowns and radio buttons  
- Checking checkboxes  
- Submitting forms and verifying results  

## ⏱️ Waits & Timeouts

Handle dynamic web content by:  

- Implementing explicit and implicit waits  
- Setting timeouts for actions and navigation  
- Waiting for elements to appear, disappear, or change state  

## 📸 Screenshots & Videos

Capture and record test execution to:  

- Take screenshots of pages or elements  
- Record videos of test runs  
- Use media for debugging and reporting  

## 🏗️ Page Object Model (POM)

Learn the Page Object Model to:  

- Organize tests and page interactions  
- Reuse code across multiple tests  
- Make test maintenance easier and more scalable
