# 🚀 30 Days to Automation

Welcome to my **30-Day Automation Journey** — a personal project where I document my daily progress as I learn **PlayWright**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and more! This challenge is all about consistency, growth, and building real-world skills step by step. 🌱

## 🎯 Project Goal

To become confident in **automation** by dedicating 30 days to learning, coding, and practicing automation tools, scripting, and frameworks.

By the end of these 30 days, I’ll have:
- A collection of daily coding exercises and projects.
- Hands-on experience using JavaScript and other tools for automation.
- Improved confidence in web testing, CI/CD, and QA best practices.
