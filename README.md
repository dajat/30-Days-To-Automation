# 🚀 30 Days to Automation

Welcome to my **30-Day Automation Journey** — a personal project where I document my daily progress as I learn and practice **automation testing**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and more!  
This challenge is all about consistency, growth, and building real-world skills step by step. 🌱
