# 🎯 JavaScript & Playwright Learning

This repository documents focused on learning **advanced JavaScript concepts** and **Playwright fundamentals**. The goal is to understand and build interactive web pages, manipulate the DOM, and automate browser testing.

## 📘 Overview

The focus areas of this challenge include:

- **Arrays & Objects**: Data structures, methods, and manipulation  
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting elements, updating content, creating elements dynamically  
- **ES6 Features**: `let`/`const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, modules, and more  
- **Event Handling**: Listening to user actions, handling clicks, inputs, and form submissions  
- **Playwright Fundamentals**: Automating browser interactions, writing tests, and understanding core Playwright APIs  

## 📝 JavaScript Arrays & Objects

Practice using arrays and objects for:  

- Storing and retrieving data  
- Iterating with loops and array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`)  
- Updating, deleting, and manipulating object properties  

## ⚙️ DOM Manipulation

Learn to:  

- Select elements using `querySelector` and `getElementById`  
- Update element content and styles dynamically  
- Create, append, and remove elements  
- Traverse the DOM and modify attributes  

## ✨ ES6 Features

Includes practice with:  

- `let` and `const` for variable scope  
- Arrow functions for concise syntax  
- Template literals for dynamic strings  
- Destructuring arrays and objects  
- Modules and import/export  

## 🖱️ Event Handling

Practice handling user interactions:  

- `click`, `input`, `submit`, and other event types  
- Event listeners and callbacks  
- Event delegation for dynamic elements  

## 🤖 Playwright Fundamentals

Learn the basics of Playwright for browser automation:  

- Launching browsers and pages  
- Locating and interacting with elements  
- Writing tests and assertions  
- Automating navigation and form submissions
