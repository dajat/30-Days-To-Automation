**🎯 30-Day Playwright Learning Challenge**

This repository documents my progress over the first week of my self-directed challenge to learn Playwright, alongside practice with JavaScript, project structure, and Git workflows.

**📘 Overview**

The goal of this challenge is to build a solid foundation in Playwright through consistent, incremental learning. Each day focuses on a specific concept related to browser automation, testing strategies, or Playwright tooling.

- 📂 Repository Structure
- 📝 HTML File Creation
- Includes simple HTML test pages used for practicing browser interactions such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and validating UI elements.

**⚙️ JavaScript & Playwright Scripts**

Contains Playwright test scripts and supporting JavaScript files demonstrating:

- Test configuration and setup
- Page interactions
- Assertions and selectors
- Reusable utilities and functions

**🗃️ Directory Organization**

Exercises and files are organized by topic or daily milestone to maintain a clean and scalable structure throughout the challenge.

**🌿 Git Version Control**

Daily progress is tracked using Git, with commits documenting updates such as:

- New test files
- Script improvements
- Refactoring
- Exploration of Playwright features
